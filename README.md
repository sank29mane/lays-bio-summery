# Biomedical Literature Summarization Project

## 📖 Overview

This project implements an automated biomedical text summarization system using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to process biomedical literature and generate concise, meaningful summaries that preserve key scientific information.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a robust biomedical text summarization model
- Train and evaluate the model on biomedical literature datasets
- Provide tools for automatic summarization of scientific papers
- Enable efficient literature review and knowledge extraction

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
pip install torch transformers nltk scikit-learn
```

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sank29mane/lays-bio-summery.git
   cd lays-bio-summery
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks in order**:
   - First: `Model_training(biolaysumm).ipynb`
   - Then: `Evaluation.ipynb`

## 📊 Model Performance

*Results from model evaluation will be documented here after running the evaluation notebook*

## 🔬 Use Cases

- **Literature Review**: Quickly summarize multiple research papers
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Extract key findings from biomedical texts
